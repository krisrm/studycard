This was my summer project for 2010; I used some of the concepts and source from a software engineering course I'd taken to build a simple way to study for tests that required lots of memorization. This version of StudyCards is written in Swing, so it is cross-platform.

Plans for this include a vastly improved Metro version for the Windows app store in Summer 2012!
